What do you understand By Data Redundancy?

                                Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data exists in multiple places,
                                whereas data inconsistency is when the same data exists in different formats in multiple tables. 
                                Unfortunately, data redundancy can cause data inconsistency, which can provide a company with                  
                                unreliable and/or meaningless information.
